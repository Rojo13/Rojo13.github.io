		<p>What will be the impact be on pollution? People assume it will be good for the environment as cars won't have to seach for parking but maybe not. People might commute from farther if they can work in the car while commuting. Also maybe more people will drive as it will be cheapear. If more drive, public transportation investments may decline and a death spiral could be created.</p>
